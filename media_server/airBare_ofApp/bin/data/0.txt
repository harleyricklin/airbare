Why is the air in Louisville so polluted? It's partly our geography... Louisville lies in the Ohio River valley, between two plateaus. This means that air gets trapped and stagnates, especially on hot summer days. This trapped air forms a kind of lid over the city, stopping the dirty air from escaping. 
According to the World Health Organization, air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide.
Children are more vulnerable to air pollution because they breathe faster than adults and inhale more air per pound of body weight. Asthma is the third leading cause of hospitalization among children under the age of 15, and children's asthma symptoms are worsened by increased car exhaust and other forms of air pollution.
You can survive for a few weeks without food and a few days without water—but you would only last a few minutes without air. You take, on average, 23,000 breaths a day, inhaling more than 3,000 gallons of air. [Use this fact if not already included on Second Intro Screen.]
Air pollution causes car tires to crack and become porous... imagine what it's doing to your lungs!
Astronauts report that thick smog over highly polluted areas can be seen from the international space station, and that the amount of air pollution visible to them has been increasing. 
Your lungs are much bigger than you think... if you laid your lungs out flat they would cover two-thirds of a tennis court.
Your left and right lungs aren't exactly the same. The lung on the right side of your body has three lobes while the lung on your left side only has two... this leaves some room for your heart!
Smog is a type of air pollutant. The word "smog" was made up in the early 20th century as a combination of the words smoke and fog.
Ancient yogis believed we only have so many breaths for our life. If that's true, we should make sure every breath is a good one!
The idea that polluted air can be harmful to humans dates back to the Middle Ages. Direct evidence of bad effects from polluted air began to accumulate after the first use of coal around the beginning of the fourteenth century. 
One of the worst air pollution disasters occurred in London in December 1952. The combination of cold weather and stagnant air meant that airborne pollutants (mostly from the use of coal) were trapped and hung over the city in a thick layer of smog for five days. The smog was so dense that people could only see a few feet in front of them. At the time, it was thought that this “great smog” caused 4000 deaths. More recent research suggests it actually led to approximately 12,000 deaths. Most of the deaths were caused by respiratory tract infections and as a result of mechanical obstruction of the air passages by pus arising from lung infections caused by the smog.
Our lungs can hold between 4-6 liters of air, but we use only a small portion of this space with each breath.
Most of the oxygen we breathe comes from the sea. Tiny ocean algae produce the majority of the oxygen in the atmosphere.
