Why is the air in Louisville so polluted? It's partly geography. Louisville lies in a river valley between two plateaus, which means air gets trapped and stagnates (especially on hot days), forming a lid over the city that stops the pollution from escaping. 
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, tasteless, odorless gas. It is the most abundant pollutant in cities and is "long-lasting," with an average lifespan of 2-4 months. It is also highly toxic: CO poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries. 
You take, on average, 23,000 breaths a day, inhaling more than 3,000 gallons of air into your lungs. And your lungs are much bigger than you think... if you laid them out flat they would cover one side of a tennis court!
With every breath you take, you're inhaling particulate matter (PM), which is made up of soil and dust particles, metals, organic chemicals, and acids. PM is the deadliest form of air pollution. It can settle deep in the lungs, making it hard to breathe, and can even pass through the lungs to other organs, like the brain.
A single car dropping off and picking up kids at school puts 3 pounds of pollution into the air per month. So use your car less by joining a carpool with other parents, taking the bus, or walking your kids to school.
