Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring gas - when we breathe out, we exhale carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is also the main greenhouse gas: it represents about 84% of all the greenhouse gases produced by human activities, totaling about 30 billion tons a year. 
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. We need a certain amount of greenhouse gas - without these gases, we'd freeze! - but too much greenhouse gas can cause the temperature to increase out of control. So... more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means that the atmosphere is retaining more heat and temperatures are therefore rising around the world. 
The main human activity that produces carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels - coal, natural gas, and oilâ€”for electricity and transportation. Every gallon of gas you use produces about 19 pounds of carbon dioxide. 
For millions of years the production of carbon dioxide was kept in check by the natural systems of the planet - it was produced and absorbed at a fairly steady rate. However, humans changed that balancing act around 1760, with the start of the Industrial Revolution. Since that time we have been adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere at a steadily increasing rate, trapping heat and warming the planet. 
Before the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels were about 270 parts per million (ppm). In 1960, carbon dioxide levels were at about 313 ppm. Now they're at around 400 ppm. Many climate scientists say levels need to be reduced to 350 ppm to avoid the effects of climate change. Carbon dioxide levels have not been below 350 ppm since 1988.
More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also means increased ozone and particle concentrations. Long-term exposure to ozone has been shown to increase risk of death from respiratory illness. One study showed that people living in cities with high ozone levels had an over 30% increased risk of dying from lung disease.
