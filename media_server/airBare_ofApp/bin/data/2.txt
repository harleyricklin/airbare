The idea that polluted air can be harmful to humans dates back to the Middle Ages. Direct evidence of bad effects from polluted air began to accumulate after the first use of coal around the beginning of the 14th century. 
Carbon monoxide (CO) is produced by natural and man-made fires and by the exhaust of internal combustion engines, including vehicles, portable generators, and lawn mowers, etc. It is also produced by the incomplete combustion of various other fuels such as wood, coal, charcoal, oil, and even trash.
Particulate matter is the main cause of the "haze" in the air that you see in parts of the United States, including many of our national parks and wilderness areas. It also stains and damages stone, destroying treasured statues and monuments.
Carbon monoxide (CO) enters the body through the lungs, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. When you have too much CO in your system, it reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen. 
Diesel exhaust contains forty chemicals that are classified as "hazardous air pollutants." When you idle your car engine, you're releasing this toxic exhaust into the air - so if you're stopped for more than 30 seconds (except in traffic), turn off your engine!
