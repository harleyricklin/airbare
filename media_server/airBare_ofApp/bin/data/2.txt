Particulate matter (also known as particle pollution or PM) is the deadliest form of air pollution. It is made up of soil and dust particles, metals, organic chemicals, and acids. Some of this particulate matter is large enough to be seen with the naked eye, while some is 30 times finer than a single human hair.
Some particulate matter occurs naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest fires, and even sea spray. However, human activities generate significant amounts of particulate matter: the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants, and various industrial processes contributes greatly to the amount of particulate matter in our air.
With every breath you take, you're inhaling particulate matter. The size of the particulate matter largely determines where in the respiratory tract the particle will come to rest: larger particles may be filtered by the nose and throat, but smaller particles can settle deep in the lungs. Very small particles can even pass through the lungs to affect other organs, including the brain.
When the tiny particles penetrate deep into the lungs and the blood stream, they can cause permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, and premature death. Other health problems caused by particulate matter include irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and increased respiratory symptoms, such as irritation of the airways, coughing or difficulty breathing.
Fine particles are the main cause of the “haze” in the air that you see in parts of the United States, including many of our treasured national parks and wilderness areas.
