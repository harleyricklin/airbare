Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, tasteless, and odorless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is the most abundant pollutant in urban atmospheres and is very stable and "long-lasting," having an average lifespan of 2-4 months. It is also highly toxic: carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries. 
Every year more than 500 Americans die from accidental carbon monoxide exposure caused by consumer products such as furnaces, ranges, water heaters, and gas and kerosene room heaters, and engine-powered equipment such as portable generators.
Carbon monoxide is present in small amounts in the atmosphere, largely as a product of volcanic activity. It is also produced by natural and man-made fires, such as forest and bush fires, and by the exhaust of internal combustion engines, including vehicles, portable generators, lawn mowers, power washers, etc. It is also produced by the incomplete combustion of various other fuels such as wood, coal, charcoal, oil, natural gas, and even trash.
Carbon monoxide enters the body through the lungs, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. Hemoglobin in the blood combines much more easily with carbon monoxide than with oxygen, so when you have too much carbon monoxide in your system, it reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen to body cells and tissues. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can include headaches, fatigue, vision and judgment impairment, dizziness, and drowsiness. 
Large carbon monoxide pollution events in our cities can be seen from space.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384â€“322 BC) first recorded that burning coals emanated toxic fumes. In fact, in ancient times criminals were executed by being shut in a bathing room with smoldering coals: nobody knew how or why this worked, but they knew it was lethal.
