We can make easy choices every day that help to reduce pollution and make our air safer to breathe. Doing your bit doesn't have to be hard! Join our Twitter campaign: @airbare. You can share your concerns about pollution in Louisville and let people know about your efforts to improve our air.
Make your own air sensor and then share your results @airbare. Visit X for instructions. It's a fun project to make with kids... let's get people of all ages involved in making our air safe to breathe!
You can check your air quality online by visiting www.airnow.gov and entering your zip code. Tweet @airbare and let us know the results for your neighborhood.
If you smell or see something that might be an air pollution problem, like a car with a smoking exhaust, call the Louisville Air Pollution Control District on (502) 574-6000.
If you see big clouds of dust at a construction site, in a parking lot, or coming off a truck, call the Louisville Air Pollution Control District on (502) 574-6000. 
If you think someone is burning when they shouldn't, or if the burning is taking place when the wind is too high or there's an Air Quality Alert, immediately call the Louisville Air Pollution Control District on (502) 574-6000. 
Use your car less! A single vehicle dropping off and picking up kids at school puts three pounds of pollution into the air per month. Join a carpool with other parents, take the bus, or walk your kids to school.
Air pollution is especially bad in the summer. On hot days fill your gas tank during cooler evening hours... this will cut down on evaporation. And when you fill your gas tank be careful not to spill any gas. 
Recycling helps to reduce pollution! If we recycle paper, plastic, glass bottles, cardboard, and cans, we don't have to make as many new items... and this helps to reduce production emissions.
Thirty seconds of idling in your car can use more fuel than turning off the engine and restarting it. If you are stopped for more than 30 seconds—except in traffic—turn off your engine. Don't wait in long drive-thru lines at fast-food restaurants... park your car and go inside.
Avoid getting stuck in rush-hour traffic. More idling means more diesel exhaust in our air—and diesel exhaust contains forty chemicals that are classified as "hazardous air pollutants" under the Clean Air Act. Try not to travel during peak periods or try taking a route that avoids the traffic.
Take care of your car. Keep your tires properly inflated and get regular engine tune ups and car maintenance checks (especially for the spark plugs).
Plant trees! If you plant deciduous trees in your garden, they'll provide shade in the summer and allow light in the winter.
Make sure you keep your fireplace well maintained. If you have an old wood stove, think about replacing it with EPA-certified models.
When you're going a short distance, walk or ride a bike rather than take a car. It's good for your breathing in more ways than one!
Paints, stains, and finishes sometimes contain volatile organic compounds (VOC) that contribute to pollution and are linked to respiratory illnesses... so make sure you choose low-VOC or water-based paints, stains, finishes, and paint strippers.
