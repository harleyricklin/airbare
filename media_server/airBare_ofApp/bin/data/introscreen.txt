Recognize this scene? This is a photograph of Fourth Street in 1943. And that haze you can see in the background is soot - dirty, polluted air caused by factories and homes burning coal, oil, wood, and other fuels. Generations of Louisvillians breathed in this sooty air every day and suffered the consequences: heart disease, asthma attacks, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses. 
If you look down Fourth Street today, what can you see? The smog has gone and the sky is clear... but that doesn't mean the air around us is safe to breathe. In fact, although our city has done a lot over the past seventy years to improve air quality, we still have a long way to go before we can breathe easy - in 2014, the American Lung Association ranked Louisville the 13th most polluted city in the United States, tied with New York.
