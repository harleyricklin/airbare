This is Fourth Street in 1943. And that haze you can see is soot - air pollution caused by factories and homes burning coal, oil, and other fuels. Generations of Louisvillians breathed in this dirty air every day and suffered the consequences: heart disease, asthma attacks, bronchitis, and other illnesses.
If you look down Fourth Street today, what can you see? The sky is clear, but that doesn't mean our air is safe to breathe - in fact, in 2014 Louisville was ranked the 13th most polluted city in the U.S., tied with New York. So how do we see whatâ€™s really in the air around us?
